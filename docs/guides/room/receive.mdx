While connected to a room, the server may send down one or more audio/video/data tracks at any time. By default, a client automatically subscribes to a received track, and lets your app know by invoking callbacks on the room object and associated participant who published the track.

## Track subscription

Receiving tracks from the server starts with a subscription.

As mentioned in our guide on [publishing media](/guides/room/publish), dTelecom models tracks with two constructs: `TrackPublication` and `Track`. Think of a `TrackPublication` as metadata for a track registered with the server and `Track` as the raw media stream.

Track subscription callbacks provide your app with both the `Track` and `TrackPublication` objects.

Subscribed callback will be fired on both `Room` and `RemoteParticipant` objects.

  const { subscribedTracks } = useParticipant(participant);

}
```

## Media playback

Once subscribed to an audio or video track, a client usually wants to start playback of the live stream:

  ```typescript title="TypeScript"
  import { RemoteTrack, RemoteTrackPublication, RemoteParticipant } from '@dtelecom/livekit-client';

  function handleTrackSubscribed(
    track: RemoteTrack,
    publication: RemoteTrackPublication,
    participant: RemoteParticipant
  ) {
    // attach track to a new HTMLVideoElement or HTMLAudioElement
    const element = track.attach();
    parentElement.appendChild(element);
    // or attach to existing element
    // track.attach(element)
  }
  ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="react">

```tsx title="TypeScript"
export const MyComponent = ({audioTrack, videoTrack}) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <VideoRenderer track={videoTrack} isLocal={false} />
      <AudioRenderer track={audioTrack} isLocal={false} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Speaker detection

When audio tracks are published, dTelecom will detect participants who are speaking. Speaker updates are sent for both local and remote participants. They will fire on both, Room and Participant objects.

## Subscriber controls

While the default behavior for dTelecom clients is to subscribe to all newly published tracks, dTelecom supports selective subscription.
Client APIs are available to setup a connection for selective subscription and once configured, only explicitly subscribed tracks are sent down to the client.

### Client-side selective subscription

  <TabItem value="typescript">

  ```typescript title="TypeScript"
  import { Room, RoomEvent } from '@dtelecom/livekit-client';

  const room = new Room();
  await room.connect(wsUrl, token, {
    autoSubscribe: false,
  });

  room.on(RoomEvent.TrackPublished, (track, publication, participant) => {
    publication.setSubscribed(true);
  });
  ```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>


## Simulcast controls

If a video track has simulcast enabled, a receiving client may want to manually specify the maximum receivable quality. This would result a quality and bandwidth reduction for the target track. This might come in handy, for instance, when an application's user interface is displaying a small thumbnail for a particular user's video track.

    RoomEvent.TrackSubscribed,
    (track: RemoteTrack, publication: RemoteTrackPublication, participant: RemoteParticipant) => {
      if (track.kind === Track.Kind.Video) {
        publication.setVideoQuality(VideoQuality.LOW);
      }
    }
  );
  ```
