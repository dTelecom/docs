With dTelecom maintaining room state, you can use it to pass around custom application data. We have a flexible system that enables you to pass messages from both the backend, and between participants.

## Participant metadata

dTelecom participants have a `metadata` field that you could use to store application-specific data. For example, this could be the seat number around a table, or other participant-specific state.

Metadata is encoded in the [access token](/guides/access-tokens) that participants use to connect to the room.

## Data messages

From clients dTelecom lets you publish arbitrary data messages to any participants in the room via the `LocalParticipant.publishData` API. Room data is published to the SFU via WebRTC data channels; and server would forward that data to one or more participants in the room.

Since the data is sent via UDP, you have a flexibility in regard to the reliability of delivery. We support both reliable and lossy. In reliable mode, your packets will be retransmitted until they are received. For use-cases such as in-room chat, this is preferable.

When using lossy delivery, we suggest keeping data packets small (under network MTU of 1.4k). If a message is packetized into multiple packets, and a single packet doesn't arrive, your client will not receive the message at all.
