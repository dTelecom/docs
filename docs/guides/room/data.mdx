With dTelecom maintaining room state, you can use it to pass around custom application data. We have a flexible system that enables you to pass messages from both the backend, and between participants.

## Built-in chat

The simplest way to add chat to your app is the pre-built `<Chat>` component:

```tsx title="React"
import { Chat } from '@dtelecom/components-react';

// Inside a <LiveKitRoom> component:
<Chat />
```

This renders a full chat UI with message history and an input field. It requires `canPublishData: true` in the participant's token grant.

For a custom chat UI, use the `useChat` hook:

```tsx title="React"
import { useChat } from '@dtelecom/components-react';

function CustomChat() {
  const { chatMessages, send } = useChat();
  const [input, setInput] = useState('');

  return (
    <div>
      {chatMessages.map((msg) => (
        <div key={msg.timestamp}>
          <strong>{msg.from?.name}: </strong>{msg.message}
        </div>
      ))}
      <form onSubmit={(e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        send?.(input);
        setInput('');
      }}>
        <input value={input} onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)} />
        <button type="submit" disabled={!send}>Send</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
}
```

:::note
The `send` function from `useChat` may be `undefined` before the room connection is established. Always use optional chaining (`send?.('message')`) or check for `send` before calling it.
:::

Both `<Chat>` and `useChat` must be used inside a `<LiveKitRoom>` component.

## Participant metadata

dTelecom participants have a `metadata` field that you could use to store application-specific data. For example, this could be the seat number around a table, or other participant-specific state.

Metadata is encoded in the [access token](/guides/access-tokens) that participants use to connect to the room.

## Data messages

From clients dTelecom lets you publish arbitrary data messages to any participants in the room via the `LocalParticipant.publishData` API. Room data is published to the SFU via WebRTC data channels; and server would forward that data to one or more participants in the room.

Since the data is sent via UDP, you have a flexibility in regard to the reliability of delivery. We support both reliable and lossy. In reliable mode, your packets will be retransmitted until they are received. For use-cases such as in-room chat, this is preferable.

When using lossy delivery, we suggest keeping data packets small (under network MTU of 1.4k). If a message is packetized into multiple packets, and a single packet doesn't arrive, your client will not receive the message at all.

// publish to specific participants
room.localParticipant.publishData(data, DataPacket_Kind.LOSSY, ['participant_sid'])

// receive data from other participants

  const strData = decoder.decode(payload)
  ...
