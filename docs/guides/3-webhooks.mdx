dTelecom will notify your server when room events take place. This can be helpful for your backend to know when a room has finished, or when a participant leaves.

## Receiving webhooks

Webhook requests are HTTP POST requests sent to URLs that you specify in the config. A `WebhookEvent` is sent as the body of the request, encoded in JSON.

In order to ensure the requests are coming from dTelecom, the requests carry a `Authentication` header, containing a signed JWT token. The token includes a sha256 hash of the payload.

dTelecom server SDKs provide webhook receiver libraries that will help with validation and decoding of the payload.

<Tabs
    defaultValue="node"
    groupId="server-sdk"
    values={[
        {label: 'Node', value: 'node'},
    ]}>
  <TabItem value="node">

```typescript title="TypeScript"
import { WebhookReceiver } from '@dtelecom/server-sdk-js';

const receiver = new WebhookReceiver("apikey", "apisecret");

// In order to use the validator, WebhookReceiver must have access to the raw POSTed string (instead of a parsed JSON object)
// if you are using express middleware, ensure that `express.raw` is used for the webhook endpoint
// router.use('/webhook/path', express.raw());

app.post('/webhook-endpoint', (req, res) => {
  // event is a WebhookEvent object
  const event = receiver.receive(req.body, req.get('Authorization'))
})
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>
