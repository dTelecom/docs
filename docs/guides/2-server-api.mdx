title: Server APIs
---

dTelecom has built-in APIs that lets you to manage rooms and moderate participants. These APIs are designed to be used by your backend.

Room APIs are built on top of [Twirp](https://twitchtv.github.io/twirp/docs/intro.html), and differ from a traditional REST interface. Arguments are passed via POSTing JSON body to the endpoints.

Room APIs are fully distributed across multiple nodes. Each instance is capable of fulfilling requests about any room or participant.

### Authorization header

All of the APIs require a signed access token. The token should be set in HTTP headers as

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Post body

Twirp expects each request to be a HTTP POST. The body of the request should be
a JSON object (`application/json`) containing parameters specific to each request. For requests
that takes no parameters, an empty `{}` body should be used.
