title: Access Tokens
---
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

For a dTelecom client to successfully connect to the server, it must pass an access token with the request.

This token encodes the identity of a participant, name of the room, capabilities and permissions. Access tokens are JWT-based and signed with your API secret to prevent forgery.

Since participant identity is unique within the room, each access token can be used only by a single participant.

## Creating a token

<Tabs
  defaultValue="node"
  groupId="server-sdk"
  values={[
    {label: 'Node', value: 'node'},
  ]}>
  <TabItem value="node">

```typescript title="TypeScript"
import { AccessToken } from '@dtelecom/server-sdk-js';

const roomName = 'name-of-room';
const participantIdentity = 'unique-identity';
const participantName = 'display name';

const at = new AccessToken('api-key', 'secret-key', {
  identity: participantIdentity,
  name: participantName,
});
at.addGrant({ roomJoin: true, room: roomName, canPublish: true, canSubscribe: true });

const token = at.toJwt();
console.log('access token', token);
```

  </TabItem>

</Tabs>

## Room permissions

Room permissions are specified in the `video` field of a decoded join token. It may contain one or more of the following properties:

| field        | type   | description                                               |
| :----------- | :----- | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| roomCreate   | bool   | permission to create rooms                                |
| roomJoin     | bool   | permission to join a room                                 |
| roomAdmin    | bool   | permission to moderate a room                             |
| room         | string | name of the room, required if join or admin is set        |
| canPublish   | bool   | allow participant to publish tracks                       |
| canSubscribe | bool   | allow participant to subscribe to tracks                  |

### Example: subscribe-only token

To create a token where the participant can only subscribe, and not publish into the room, you would use the following grant:

```json
{
  ...
  "video": {
    "room": "myroom",
    "roomJoin": true,
    "canSubscribe": true,
    "canPublish": false,
    "canPublishData": false
  }
}
```

## Token expiration

A tokens has an expiration time. We recommend setting it to the expected duration of a session. A dTelecom client will store a token for the entire session duration, in case it needs to reconnect.

## Participant metadata

You may also attach any arbirary metadata onto each participant via the `metadata` field. This data is opaque to dTelecom.

When provided, dTelecom will attach the metadata to the participant object that the clients would receive.
